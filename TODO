Items todo:

* add in static type checking (mypy) and pylint
  - how to do this automatically?

* add in ability to scan for repo directories

* add in ability to continue from where last (failed) scan stopped
  - note that a scan only stops if the "stop on error" option is set

* fix bug where default directory is hard-coded, even though there
  is a default value
  
* add ability to specify type of repo (e.g. "git", etc), for
  operations where appropriate (like list, update, clean)

* show better progress info: at least the repo count?
  (e.g. at least repo number, or "N of M"?)

* store/retrieve DB file as a single data struct.
  - would require creating a data structure/class for the data

* create a man page?

* make subcommand gathering/usage automatic, i.e. any method in some
  sub-directory, or matching a name pattern?

* add selt-tests! -- pyunit is ok for unit testing, but we also
  need command-level testing
