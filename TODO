Items todo:

* update install systemm (kill setup.py)

* add in static type checking (and pylint)

* add in ability to scan for repo directorys

* add in ability to continue from where last (failed) scan stopped
  - note that a scan only stops if the "stop on error" option is set

* add in ability to pass in one or more directories to scan

* use pyproject automatic front-end generation for the "ur" entry point?

* add option to pass in UR database directory

* fix bug where default directory is hard-coded, even though there
  is a default value
  
* add ability to specify type of repo (e.g. "git", etc), for
  operations where appropriate (like list, update, clean)

* show better progress info: at least the repo count?
  (e.g. at least repo number, or "N of M"?)
